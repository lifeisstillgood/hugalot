   <h1>Have yoU Got A Licence fOr That?</h1>

Yes, seriously.  Licenses are what councils, certainly in Britain, 
do best.  And yet the differences between the licence-experience
in the same council can be vast.  

Hug-a-lot is an Open Source online service that provides councils with 
a ready made, best practise licensing portal that they can configure and 
adapt in any way to meet their particular needs.
